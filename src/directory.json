        "Power":"Once a Banshee uses its power, it will begin to navigate to its chosen target. Line-of-sight blockers and hiding have no effect on the Banshee's ability to navigate to the player, and it will be able to reach them. It will not actually follow the player, but it will mark the target's location at the time its power was used. After reaching the location, it will wait ~20 seconds, then proceed to begin a Hunt if the player has been within direct line-of-sight of the Banshee during this waiting time. Originally, the Banshee would never switch targets unless the target died or left the game, and would cancel its ability if no players are in the building, disabling its ability to hunt. As of v0.26.5. however, Banshees are now able to freely hunt other players if its target is absent from the building. The Banshee is capable of hunting players that are very far away from the ghost room who think they are safe, even on the largest of maps. A Banshee that uses its power to hunt before the ghost room is located can also trick players into thinking the ghost room is close, as they hear the ghost nearby, when in reality the Banshee has just walked from a different location of the map to the player. Unless the target is outside, the Banshee can ignore Sanity and typical hunting rules, meaning it can potentially begin a Hunt with its power within moments of the hunters entering the location on Professional or Intermediate difficulties. A hunt beginning very early on while all players have high Sanity is a very strong sign of a Banshee using its power. The Banshee will also ignore players that are not its target during a hunt, allowing for easy photos and little need to hide while the target is known, assuming they do not leave the building or are killed.
