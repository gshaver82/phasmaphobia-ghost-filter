# Description
this React web app will allow players of the game phasmaphobia to quickly filter out what ghost type they are dealing with. click once to confirm an evidence, and click again to exclude it. the program will automatically let you know which pieces of evidence are still relevant. for example, if freezing and EMF5 are confirmed checking spirit box and ghost writing is not needed. the only 2 ghosts left at this point both do not have spirit box and ghost writing.so, fingerprints and orbs will be noted with "check this!"

click the details button to expand on the info for each ghost if desired. All info taken from the phasmaphobia wiki. click the reset all to unknown button to reload the page and be ready for a new game. 

playtested several times with great success!
